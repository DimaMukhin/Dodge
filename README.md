# Dodge
Dodge is a very fun and addicting game that I have made using Java. In the game you control a white square, and your mission is to dodge all the other objects flying around on the screen. As the game progresses, you need to avoid faster and smarter objects and even a boss at the end. The point of the game is to stay alive for the most time possible and to set a high score!
